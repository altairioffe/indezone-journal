      First, let’s get a better idea of what we’re working with: <b>your mind</b>.

      </Typography>

      The human mind (<i>your</i> mind) is the most powerful supercomputer that we know of. 
      When you dream at night, it casually creates entire new worlds and realities— and that’s just while you’re sleeping. 
      
            </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>
      It also creates your “normal” reality when you’re awake. Most importantly, it wants to keep you safe. That's a big job, and it got you this far.
      </Typography>
    </div>
